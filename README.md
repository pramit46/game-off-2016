# Knot Fun

Knot Fun is a modern take on the timeless classic... the knot. Really. 

Did untying that ball of christmas lights leave you unsatisfied and wanting more? Do you look forward to pulling your headphones out of your pocket in a jumbled mess? Then Knot Fun is for you! It brings knots into the future and into your pocket wherever you go!

Knot Fun is a pseudo-puzzle time-waster where you literally just untie randomly generated knots. I built it solo using C#, Unity, and Gimp. It's a free app on both the Android and iOS app stores.

I admit, it's a stretch to fit the theme, but as the word "loosely" was italicized in the original game-off blog post, I'm hoping Knot Fun will still make the cut as a modern and virtual take on a classic.

Enjoy! :)
